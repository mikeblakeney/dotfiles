# Dotfiles

These are the configuration files I use while developing.  The setup file will create symlinks for all the dotfiles and will install the vim plugins using vundler.  Inspired by [this](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/) article and [michaeljsmalley/dotfiles](https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles) .

## Usage
1.  clone the repository into your home directory
```
git clone git@github.com:mikeblakeney/dotfiles.git ~
```

2. From your home directory run `setup.sh`
```
cd ~
dotfiles/setup.sh
```
